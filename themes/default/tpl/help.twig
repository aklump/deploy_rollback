usage: deploy <command> [<args>]

These are your available commands:

    offline   Take your website offline for testing.

    online    Bring your website online for normal traffic.

    pull      Deploy the project. This option will back up the database and then do a git pull, after which it will run a drupal database update and clear the caches. It will also make a note of the current position to be used if you need to rollback. Optional arguments:

              --no-updb   Do not run the Drupal database update.
              --no-cc     Do not clear Drupal's cache.


   rollback   Rollback to the state before last `pull` command.

Calling 'deploy' without a command is equivalent to 'deploy help'
